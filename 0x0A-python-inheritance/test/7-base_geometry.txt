This is a detailed text file for the BaseGeometry class.

The BaseGeometry class is defined with the intention of being a base class for
various geometric shapes. It includes methods that are common to all
geometric shapes, such as area calculation and parameter validation.

Class Definition:
-----------------
class BaseGeometry:
    "Represents base geometry."

    The class is named 'BaseGeometry' and represents the concept of a basic
        geometric shape.

Method Definitions:
-------------------
1. def area(self):
    "Not yet implemented."

    The 'area' method is supposed to calculate the area of a geometric shape.
        However, in this base class, it's not implemented and serves as a
	placeholder. When called, it raises an Exception to indicate that any
	      subclass should implement this method.

  Exception Raised:
       - Exception: "area() is not implemented"
	            This exception is raised to inform the user that the 'area'
		    method needs to be implemented in a subclass.

2. def integer_validator(self, name, value):
    "Validate a parameter as an integer."

    The 'integer_validator' method is a utility function that validates
        whether a given parameter 'value' is an integer. It takes two arguments:
	- name (str): The name of the parameter, used for identification
		        in error message
	- value (int): The parameter value that needs to be validated.

    If the 'value' is not an integer, a TypeError is raised with a message
        indicating which parameter is invalid.

  Exceptions Raised:
            - TypeError: If 'value' is not an integer, a TypeError is raised
	    with a message "<name> must be an integer", where <name> is replaced
	    with the actual name of the parameter.

Usage:
------
The BaseGeometry class is intended to be used as a superclass for other
geometric shape classes. These subclasses should provide their own
implementation of the 'area' method and can utilize the 'integer_validator'
method to ensure that parameters are of the correct type.

Note:
-----
This class is a part of a larger module or application that deals with
geometric shapes. It provides a foundation for consistent
behavior and validation across various shapes.
